Title:"Github Basics for college Projects"
Introduction : Learning GitHub is highly useful for college projects, especially in fields like computer science and engineering.
1. Version control : GitHub uses Git, a version control system that tracks changes in code, documents, or any file over time. This allows you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and work confidently without losing work.
2. Open-Source Contribution : If you learn GitHub, you can contribute to open-source projects. This helps you apply your skills, gain practical experience, and collaborate with experienced developers globally.
3. Centralized Repository : With, GitHub, your team can store all code and files in one place, making it easy for everyone to access and work with the latest version of the project. This reduces confusion around file sharing and ensures everyoneâ€™s working on the same codebase.
Sections:My goals with github:
1. Build a Professional Network: Connect with other developers, follow their projects, and contribute. You can learn a lot from observing how experienced developers write code and structure their projects.
2. Learn Git: GitHub is an excellent platform to deepen your understanding of Git, a version control tool. Learning Git commands and concepts will help in most development and DevOps roles.
3. Collaborate on Open Source Projects: Contribute to existing projects in your field of interest or specialization (like AI). This can help you gain experience, build connections, and work on real-world codebases.
Steps I will take to get confortable with github : Understand git basics
 1. Learn the essential Git commands like git init, git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git clone, and git status.
Practice these commands by initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing them to GitHub.
